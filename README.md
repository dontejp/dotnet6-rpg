This is a role playing game. Users can create their own characters with abilities and attributes and take them to battle!

Through the use of Asp.NetCore players use HTTP CRUD calls to manage their party, abilities and attack.

User authentication is activated in order to protect Users from accounts being "hacked". 
Password salting and hashing has also been implemented to ensure safety in the event of a database breach.
